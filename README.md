# terminal_escape
This is a game made for practicing the command line through bash.
This i primarly a PRACTISE PROJECT for me and my fellow students the AI engineering program.  

To play, run ```bash python main.py ```

The goal is to have a game where the player progressively gets more bash commands.

To-do list for those who want to contribute:

-LS is not working properly, it lists files in sub directories (fixed)

-CD is not consistent with syntax, sometime cd /dir and sometime cd dir/

-Spelling mistakes in the txt files

-Add mv command to move file.

-Fuck around untill you break something, then report

-Add some graphics in top half

-Add music or sound effects

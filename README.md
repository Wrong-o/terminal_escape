# terminal_escape
This is a game made for practicing the command line through bash.
This i primarly a PRACTISE PROJECT for me and my fellow students the AI engineering program.  

To play, run ```bash python main.py ```

The goal is to have a game where the player progressively gets more bash commands.

To-do list for those who want to contribute:

-LS is not working properly, it lists files in sub directories

-Spelling mistakes in the txt files

-Add mv command to move file.
